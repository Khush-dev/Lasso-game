# Lasso-game
This is a Lasso game based on simplecpp.
This was the final project I made for CS 101. The game's starter code was given, and then I made a few modifications to it, as was required in by the assignment.

To run the project, one first needs to download simplecpp. The instructions for downloading simplecpp can be found [here](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp/).

There are two game modes, Classic and Space.
-Space (zero gravity):
   Randomly spawning portals and coins, at random speeds make the game challenging.
-Classic:
   The Classic Lasso game, with some modifications!

There are three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard.
User can change the theme and background. Currently, there are two options, Dark theme and Light theme.
There is a new notification center.
These are the random tips:
"Stay away from bombs!", "Time your throw well", "Don't forget to yank ;) ",
"A Magnet lasts for 5 seconds |=_=|  ", "Beware of Bombs! |=_*| ", "Red coins are Magnetic '-' ",
"Longer the portal, faster the coin" ,"Two coins in one throw earns a life!", "Space looks pretty in the dark"
